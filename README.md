# Programming-language-theory-projet
an environment where a user can describe his automaton (alphabet, initial state, final states and all transitions), save it and perform several operations such as: 
- The reduction of an automaton 
- The complement of an automaton 
- The mirror of an automaton 
- The recognition of words in a deterministic automaton
